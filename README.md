Projects that I wrote/worked on at MHacks 2016! 


Dronewatch - A platform that can analyze a drone's aerodynamic profile and search it within an established database of drone profiles to tell the user what kind of drone it is, with all of the technical information listed. Invaluable to the amateur hobbyist and tactical military operator alike!
